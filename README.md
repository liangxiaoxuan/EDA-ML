Statistical Significance of Features Analysis
--

About to mainly investigate what factor can affect of eight predictors of different building features on outcome called cooling load with data analysis. 

The basic steps of analysis:
* Did the assumption tests to know if there are some problems from the datasets and also. 
* Based on the numeric outcome,  we used 4 models to do the prediction with relevant cross-validation.


### Dataset:
From UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency:
Total samples: 768 
#### Predictor variables:
* Relative Compactness 
* Surface Area
* Wall Area
* Roof Area
* Overall Height 
* Orientation
* Glazing Area
* Glazing Area Distribution
#### Outcome variable:
* Cooling Load (numeric)

### Statistical Method 
* Linear Regression 
* Residual plot
* correlation plots
* Box Cox Transformation
* Lack-of-fit test
* Variable Selection stepwise

### Machine learning Method
* Spline model
* LASSO
* RandomForest
