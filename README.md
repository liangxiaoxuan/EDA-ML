About to mainly investigate what factor can affect of eight predictors of different building features on outcome called cooling load with data analysis. 

The basic steps of analysis:
* Did the assumption tests to know if there are some problems from the datasets and also. 
* Based on the numeric outcome,  we used 4 models to do the prediction with relevant cross-validation.
